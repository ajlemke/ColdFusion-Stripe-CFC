This is a ColdFusion wrapper for the Stripe.com API (http://stripe.com)

It supports all the methods of the Stripe API.

Compatible with Railo and Adobe ColdFusion.


BASIC USAGE - works great with Stripe.js (https://gist.github.com/1084146) although it is not necessary

Within your Application.cfc place the following code:

application.stripeApiKey = 'YOUR STRIPE SECRET PUBLISHABLE KEY';
application.Stripe = createObject('component','path.to.Stripe').init(stripeApiKey=application.stripeApiKey);


On the page you want to process payments:

local.StripeResult = application.Stripe.createCharge(amount=form.amount,card=form.stripeToken,description='Payment for products');


NOTE:

If you receive the following error:

401 Unauthorized
{ "error": { "type": "invalid_request_error", "message": "Stripe no longer supports API requests made with TLS 1.0. Please initiate HTTPS connections with TLS 1.2 or later. You can learn more about this at https://stripe.com/blog/upgrading-tls." } }

Try updating to Java 8. This should fix this issue.
